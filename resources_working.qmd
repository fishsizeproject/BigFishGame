## Wild cards

***Blue Groper***

Largest fish are important in maintaining natural ecosystem in balance. For example, only the largest fish and largest rock lobsters will eat the urchins, which are decimating Tasmanian and other kelp forests. Read [*this story in the ABC magazine*](https://hyperlink.here) to learn more. 

***Giant Kelp*** 

Kelp is extremely important in providing habitats for all marine creatures.
