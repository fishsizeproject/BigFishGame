The game all about fishing in a sustainable way

</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">

The Big Fish card game aims to inform and engage everyone interested in
fishing or marine conservation through fun play. The main goal of the
game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish while
also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future
catches. The game is suitable to ages from 10 to 99+ and is best played
in a group of 2-5 players.

Main messages

</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">

This game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about

-   **Big fish are important**. They are important for population
    resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are beautiful.

-   **Big fish are mostly all gone**. Commercial and recreational
    fishing has removed most of the large fish from the ocean, lakes and
    rivers.

-   **Big fish can return**. Fish grow relatively fast and we take the
    right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their beauty
    within our lifetimes.

Game mechanics

</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">

Big fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted
to catch them. But presence of big fish also allows players to draw new
cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a
balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish
for good fishing opportunities. In addition to fishing, other natural
and human induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries
research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean
acidification and others. These events create unpredictability and new
challenges and inform about human impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
