The BigFish card game informs and engages everyone interested in fishing or marine conservation through fun play.

The goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish, while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future catches.

Big fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But the presence of big fish also allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish for good fishing opportunities.

In addition to fishing, other natural and human-induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification, and others.

These events create unpredictability and new challenges and inform us on how humans impact aquatic ecosystems.

## Main messages

<!-- This game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about: -->

::: {.homepage-p .text-center style="margin-bottom: 1.em"}
Even when there is an element of chance, all the best games need a strategy. Playing BigFish is no different, but the stakes are the survival of aquatic ecosystems, planet-wide. There are four key understandings that underpin your approach to the game:

### 1. Big fish are important

<!-- Big are important for population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are beautiful. -->
Big fish play a disproportionately important role in preserving the health and diversity of fresh and salt water ecosystems.

### 2. Big fish are vanishing fast

<!-- Commercial and recreational fishing has removed most of the large fish from the ocean, lakes and rivers. -->
Due to commercial and recreational fishing, big fish are vanishing from rivers, lakes and oceans, fast.

### 3. Big fish can return

<!-- Fish grow relatively fast and we take the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their beauty within our lifetimes. -->
Many fish species grow quickly, so big fish can be restored within our lifetimes if we play the right cards now. 

### 4. Big fish are worth saving

Fish, in their countless forms, are beautiful and irreplaceable creatures. Big fish in particular are breathtaking in their form and function, and they are worth preserving.
