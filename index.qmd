The BigFish card game informs and engages everyone interested in fishing or marine conservation through fun play.

The goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish, while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future catches.

Big fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But presence of big fish also allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish for good fishing opportunities.

In addition to fishing, other natural and human induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification and others.

These events create unpredictability and new challenges and inform us on how humans impact aquatic ecosystems.

## Game messages {style="margin-top: 0.5em;"}

This game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about:

### Big fish are important

They are important for population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are beautiful.

### Big fish are mostly all gone

Commercial and recreational fishing has removed most of the large fish from the ocean, lakes and rivers.

### Big fish can return

Fish grow relatively fast and we take the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their beauty within our lifetimes.
