The BigFish card game informs and engages everyone interested in fishing or marine ecosystems through fun play.

The goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish, while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and keeping some big fish to improve future catches.

Big fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But the presence of big fish also allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish for good fishing opportunities.

In addition to fishing, other natural and human-induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification, and others.

These events create unpredictability and new challenges and inform us on how humans impact aquatic ecosystems.

To win the game you need a good strategy and luck. There is always an element of chance, but a good fisher and player knows how to their luck. In this game you need to think about the long term strategy! The game has three main messages:

### 1. Big fish are important

Preserving the big fish in the oceans, lakes and rivers is important for fish reproduction and resilience, ecosystem balance or simply because big fish are beautiful.

<!-- Big fish play a disproportionately important role in preserving the health and diversity of fresh and salt water ecosystems. -->

### 2. Big fish are mostly gone

<!-- Commercial and recreational fishing has removed most of the large fish from the ocean, lakes and rivers. -->

Due to commercial and recreational fishing, big fish have mostly vanished from rivers, lakes and oceans.

### 3. Big fish can return

Fish grow relatively fast and if we take the right measures, we can restore them within our lifetimes and enjoy healthy ecosystems again.

<!-- Many fish species grow quickly, so big fish can be restored within our lifetimes if we play the right cards now. -->

<!-- ### 4. Big fish are worth saving -->

<!-- Fish, in their countless forms, are beautiful and irreplaceable creatures. Big fish in particular are breathtaking in their form and function, and they are worth preserving. -->
