    "text": "The Fish AI Consortium is a global network of individuals and organisations advancing artificial intelligence based image analysis to study fish population management, ecology, and conservation. We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionise the way we study, manage and protect fish populations in freshwater and marine ecosystems worldwide. By sharing resources, images, data and expertise, we aim to make a significant impact on the future of Earth’s aquatic ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goals\n\n\n\nDevelop AI-powered tools that can accurately identify fish to species, measure fish and identify individual fish from photos and videos.\nExpand the data available to fisheries managers and scientists by developing AI enhanced tools that allow image based data collection by recreational anglers, commercial fisheries, community scientists and researchers.\nMake AI resources more accessible for research and management, by developing user friendly image analyses applications and providing information and training.\nIncrease cross-disciplinary collaboration among fish biologists, fisheries researchers, computer scientists and conservation practitioners.\nApply image based AI tools to address the challenges facing fish populations, such as overfishing, habitat loss and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 3\n\n\n\n©Sebastian Pena\n\n\n\n\n2 / 3\n\n\n\n©Matthew McBrayer\n\n\n\n\n3 / 3\n\n\n\n©Milos Prelevic\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\n\n\nIdentify and collaborate across the range of image based fish AI focused projects worldwide\nShare resources such as software and trained models\nShare data, including photos and videos of fish\nCreate a public bank of images and videos for AI model training\nShare experiences and skills on common challenges\nRun educational events (seminars, workshops, training courses) on image based fish AI tools\nApply for funding for joined activities and networking\nCross-test different AI models and learning resources\nDevelop user-friendly tools for broad application of AI based models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are we\n\n\nFish AI Consortium involves a large group of people globally and is guided by a group of board members that includes world-renowned experts in the fields of artificial intelligence, fish population management, ecology and conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our work or join the consortium, please contact us using the form below.\n\n\nName:  Email:  Message: \n\n           <input type=\"text\" name=\"_gotcha\" tabindex=\"-1\" autocomplete=\"off\" />"
