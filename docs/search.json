Such changes to the natural fish population size structure impact fish population and ecosystem resilience. However, most fish populations are not assessed and humans impacts of fish size diversity loss remain undocumented.  We are using traditional and new sources of fish size data to understand how many small and large fish we should expect in natural populations, how fishing and warming are affecting these numbers and how we could restore what is lost."

    "text": "Research\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of intra-specific size distributions\nAre there general rules that govern species size distributions in natural populations? If so, we could use these rules to predict unfished size frequencies in nearly all fish species.\nTo date most analyses on fish size frequencies were conducted on commercially fished species, where fishing impacts have been extensive and long lasting. But new data sources, from underwater visual surveys, such as Reef Life Survey now provides opporunities to explore size distributions in hundreds of diverse and unfished species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature impacts on fish sizes\nTemperature affects fish sizes, both naturally and through human induced climate change. Growth, mortality, reproduction and species composition are all affected by temperature. But what are the mechanisms and how do these temperature impacts manifest in natural populations, through space and time?\nWe use diverse data sources and simulations to explore temperature impacts on fish growth, size structure and population dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying size based models to assess human impacts\nSize based models are a powerful tool to assess human impacts on fish populations. Traditionally these methods are used with catch data, but rapid accumulation of alternative data sources, such as visual census, citizen science, recreational fishing and underwater cameras, provide an opportunity to expand assessments across hundreds of fish species.\nWe are exploring best approaches to improve applications of size based population and community models to document human impacts in data poor fisheries and aquatic ecosystems in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing historical records to understand shifting baselines\nHistorical records, such as old newspapers, logbooks, photos and archival records can provide valuable information about status of fish populations before detailed surveys began. These records are crucial to improve our understanding about natural fish sizes and address shifting baselines.\nWe are working with researches around the world to find new ways to use historical data in fish population assessments."

The turn order card is available to help you keep track.\n\nDraw new cards equal to the number of large fish you have in your fishing hole, up to a maximum of 5 cards. These cards can be drawn from the face-up pile or the gameplay deck. This means that a player can either chose some unknown card or play safe and only take cards that they know (from the face-up cards). Check to see if you have any pink wild cards with a clam shell in your fishing hole (not in your hands) - they allow you to draw more cards.\nSpawn fish (place them face up in your fishing site) from your hand as a larval fish. Check to see if you have any red wild cards with a dolphin in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to spawn more fish.\nGrow fish to their next stage by rotating them from larval to juvenile, from juvenile to medium, or from medium and to big). You can grow a fish to the next stage for every big fish present in your fishing site, i.e. if you have two big fish you may grow to smaller fish to their next stage. Fish can only grow by one stage in each turn (larval to juvenile, medium to large, etc), i.e. larval juvenile cannot become big fish in one round even if you have three big fish and can have three “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green wild cards with a starfish in your fishing hole (not in your hands) – they allow you to grow more fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, catch ONE fish from your fishing site. Do this by placing it in your esky in the same orientation as you caught it. Caught large fish no longer count as big fish in your fishing site. Check to see if you have any orange wild cards with a fisher in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to catch more fish (or shellfish). Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching big fish will give you more points, but will reduce the number of cards you can draw, the number of fish you can spawn or the number of growth steps you can have.\nIf you like, play ONE wild card from your hand. Wild cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured cards are played (placed) into your fishing site to give you extra abilities or improve your site. They are permanent and apply each round. Black wildcards give one-off effects and must be discarded once they are played.",

One must safely release fish that is too small or too large for the size limits (if minimum or maximum size limits are in place). Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea, so all fish that will not be consumed should be released back safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high, e.g. over 90% or even higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nChoose a fish from the available face-up cards and either place it in your esky (cooler) or release it into your fishing spot.

Collecting enough data or conducting large analyses is important in order to get more accurate information and knowledge. However, collecting large amounts of data can be difficult, time consuming and expensive. By creating ways for everyone to get involved and have input into a science project, the knowledge gained and the positive outcomes from research can be greatly amplified and shared with the wider community.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nChoose a fish card currently in your hand and place it as a big fish into your fishing spot.

It is essential for healthy oceans and healthy fish populations and it also serves as an important refuge for marine organisms. However, giant kelp around Australia has declined drastically over the last decades, with nearly 95% of kelp around Tasmania lost. This is mostly due to climate change and invasion of long-spined sea urchins, who eat a lot of kelp and create urchin barrens. Loss of natural urchin predators, such as large rock lobsters and other large predatory fish, is one of the reasons for kelp decline, and kelp forests often survive better in no-take marine protected areas with abundant urchin predators. This huge loss of natural underwater “forests” remains largely unknown by the general public. Many scientists and organisations are working to restore these kelp forests and we all can play a role by protecting rock lobsters and aiming to restore the abundance of large lobsters and other large fish.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nIf you have a Giant Kelp card in your fishing spot you may grow two larval fish into juvenile fish each turn. The rule of one grow increment per fish per turn still applies.\n\n\n\nLearn more\nCheck out these videos about giant kelp!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelp is extremely important in providing habitats for all marine creatures, and there are currently many restoration efforts in progress.\n\nRead this Guardian article about kelp forest loss and restoration,\nLearn about giant kelp restoration efforts by IMAS, OzFish and The Nature Conservancy\nRead a scientific article about reasons for kelp decline and restoration efforts.\n\n\n\n\nHealthy giant kelp.

Known as whale pumps, these animals help by feeding in the deep oceans and pooping out large quantities of nutrients in shallow waters. These nutrients are essential for smaller species such as phytoplankton to grow. Many whale populations have been decimated by whaling, but populations of humpback whales have recovered in the last decades. This wild card shows how a visiting whale can provide positive impacts on a local environment. While they may consume some krill or small fish for food they also supply vital nutrients that are required for a healthy marine habitat and good fishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nDiscard a larval or juvenile fish from your fishing spot to grow a medium fish to a big fish. One grow per fish per turn still applies. Remember this card is discarded after use.\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\nA scientific article explaining the benefits of the “whale pump”.\nA story about the investigation of the whale nutrient pump.\nA popular article about great whales, threats and actions that can be taken to prevent them (with a focus on Canada).\n\n\n\n\nIllegal fishing\nIllegal fishing means fishing that does not follow existing regulations, be they minimum or maximum size limits, bag limits, marine protected areas or other rules. Fishing regulations are essential for sustainable fishing, but in various countries up to 20% of anglers may not obey these rules. This card shows catching fish below or above the determined size limit hurts the population and the fishing, although the damage will naturally depend on how large the overall population is in the fishing spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nChoose a player, they must choose two juvenile fish from their fishing spot and discard them (juvenile fish are below the minimum size limit and should not be fished).

    "text": "The Big Fish card game aims to inform and engage everyone interested in fishing or marine conservation through fun play.\nThe main goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future catches.\n\n\n\n Suitable for ages 10+\n\n\n\n\n Best for groups of 2-5 players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying the game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch\nBig fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But the presence of big fish in the ecosystem allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish, and grow more big fish! Players must find a balance between collecting points (by catching fish) and preserving enough fish for future fishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapt\nIn addition to fishing, other natural and human-induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn\nThese events create unpredictability and new challenges, and inform players about human impacts on aquatic ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn the rules\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about:\n\n\nBig fish are important. Big fish are important for population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are beautiful.\nBig fish are mostly all gone. Commercial and recreational fishing has removed most of the big fish from our oceans, lakes and rivers.\nBig fish can return. Fish grow relatively fast. If we take the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their beauty within our lifetimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a nice photo of some fish.
