Survival rates of fish featured in the game (such as Yellowtail Kingfish) can be above 85% when released correctly, while flathead survival rates can be about 95%.\nReleasing caught fish can greatly help fish populations. If minimum or maximum size limits are in place, fish too small or too large must be safely released. Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea! All fish that will not be consumed should be released back into the ocean safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high - often over 90%."

Often, large predators are demonised by recreational fishers who mistakenly believe that they are actively predating on fish that could otherwise be caught. In fact, many sharks are primarily scavengers which feed upon sick and old fish, not those usually targeted during recreational fishing. Without large sharks, other food chains will be affected and the ocean can become out of balance.\nSharks also keep species that predate on other important pieces of an ocean ecosystem in check. For example, many of a shark’s prey species eat seaweed, and without sharks to keep the fish population in check seaweed can become scarce. Seaweed is incredibly important in providing some species of juvenile fish with places to hide and live while in a small and vulnerable stage of life."

While they are not a standalone solution, they can be used to ensure species and ecosystems survive into the future.\nOne way marine protected areas benefit recreational fishers is that fish from the protected area can “spill over” into neighbouring areas. This works because the breeding stock of large individuals in the marine protected area are safe from fishing and will produce offspring to repopulate fishing spots. Without these protected areas, the big fish will lose protection and have the potential to be caught, so they won’t produce as many offspring for the future.\nThere are many other benefits to marine protected areas and while they need to be used in conjunction with planning and research they are still an important asset to recreational fishers."

Check to see if you have any orange Draw Wild Cards in your Fishing Spot (not in your Hand) - these allow you to Draw extra cards.\nSPAWN new fish equal to the number of Big Fish you have in your Fishing Spot.

Grow fish to their next stage by rotating them from Larval to Juvenile, from Juvenile to Medium, or from Medium to Big. Fish can only Grow by 1 size each turn (Larval to Juvenile, Medium to Big, etc), i.e. Larval and Juvenile Fish cannot become Big Fish in one round even if you have 3 Big Fish and can have 3 “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green Wild Cards in your Fishing Spot (not in your Hand) – these allow you to Grow more fish.\nIf you like, CATCH ONE 1 fish from your Fishing Spot. Catching is optional. You Catch fish by moving the fish from your Fishing Spot into your Ice Box whilst making sure the orientation (size) doesn’t change. Caught Big Fish no longer count as Big Fish in your Fishing Spot. Remember you can only Catch 1 fish per turn, unless you have yellow Wild Cards in your Fishing Spot (not in your Hand), such as fishing rod, SCUBA equipment or delicious bait. Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching Big Fish will give you more points, however, it will reduce the number of cards you can Draw, the number of fish you can Spawn or the number of Grow steps you can perform.\nIf you like, PLAY 1 Wild Card from your Hand into your Fishing Spot. Wild Cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured Wild Cards are played (placed) into your Fishing Spot to give you extra abilities or improve your Fishing Spot (these abilities activate on the player’s next turn during each corresponding turn step).

This can come as a surprise – there may still be fish being caught, and the fish may appear to be plentiful. In reality we are just getting better at catching them, or the remaining population can reach a critical point beyond which recovery is challenging without intervention. For instance, if most of the breeding population has been fished and the remaining population is being fished too fast, then the individuals left don’t have a chance to reproduce.\nThis is more likely with fish that mature at an old age, such as orange roughy that need to survive 27-32 years before they can reproduce. In the 1980s and 1990s orange roughy were being harvested by fisheries so fast that the fishery collapsed (it was no longer economically viable to harvest these fish as too few were being caught each trip). Without baseline information on how a population is structured in terms of age, size and genetics, we are unable to determine how the population is responding to harvesting by people. With this information however, managers can intervene to save a species and ensure sustainable harvesting into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nDraw a face-down card.

Therefore, a healthy seaweed ecosystem restored into the correct habitat will help return and maintain healthy fish stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nPlace a Seaweed or Giant Kelp card from your hand into your fishing spot."

    "section": "Fisheries impose upper size limit",
    "text": "Fisheries impose upper size limit\nLarge, old fish often produce disproportionately large numbers of offspring compared to fish of smaller sizes. Larger fish therefore contribute more to the next generation of fish which can be harvested. Protecting large ‘mega-spawners’ results in a greater yield of future fish. A 80 cm snapper produces ~24 times the offspring of a 40 cm snapper (but they both taste just as good!) and releasing the larger fish means more fish next year. In addition to producing disproportionately more young, large fish also connect different populations of fish – ensuring a rich and diverse gene-pool for tackling disease outbreaks and adapting to new conditions. Not all fish are made equal – big fish are more important to fish conservation into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player must spawn a larval fish into their fishing spot."

    "text": "Long spined sea urchins arrive\nLong Spined Sea Urchins have arrived in Tasmania as a range shifting specie due to warming waters induced by climate change. These urchins have been creating vast barrens on the seafloor over the last few decades. Barrens are areas that have been grazed by urchins and often consist of nothing but barren rock. This means that the habitat for many scale fish have been degraded and destroyed. Barrens can often be prevented by having an abundant number of adults marine species such as lobsters and gropers along with a commercial urchin fishery.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player must discard all Seaweed and Giant Kelp cards from their fishing spot."

You can also explore the science behind the wildcards and event cards, or learn the rules of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbalone\nGrows to 23cm, usual depth 0-40m\nGreen-lip and Black-lip Abalone are found all around the south east of Australia and are common in Tasmania. Occasionally the two hybridise to create Jade Tiger Abalone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Red Cod\nGrows to 90cm, usual depth 2-115m\nUsually found hiding under rocky ledges during the day, these fish are nocturnal hunters of fishes, crabs and crustaceans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanded Morwong\nGrows to 70cm, usual depth 1-50m\nBanded Morwong can live to 100 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBastard Trumpeter\nGrows to 65cm, usual depth 0-60m\nAs juveniles these fish inhabit shallow coastal reefs for the first few years of life. Currently in Tasmania, they are considered to be depleted, meaning their population is critically low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Fin Tuna\nGrows to 2.2m, usual depth 0-500m\nThese fish are actually endotherms, meaning they can maintain a body temperature that is warmer than the surrounding water, just like mammals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Mackerel\nGrows to 44 cm, usual depth 0-200m\nAs adults, these fish school in great numbers off the coast. However, when young they prefer the protection of inshore habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluethroat Wrasse\nGrows to 50cm, usual depth 1-50m\nThese fish are all born as females and lack a characteristic blue throat. When no males are around, dominant females morph into a male by changing size, shape and colour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrownstriped Leatherjacket\nGrows to 30cm, usual depth 0-20m\nWhilst uncommon around mainland Australia, this leatherjacket can be abundant on Tasmanian seaweed reefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraughtboard Shark\nGrows to 1.5m, usual depth 3-60m\nDraughtboard Sharks are benthic, meaning they spend most of their time on the seafloor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlounder\nGrows to 45cm, usual depth 0-100m\nFlounder are born with eye on either side of their head. When very young, one of these eyes migrates across the head so both eyes are on the same side. This is why flounder have such unusually amazing heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerring Cale\nGrows to 51cm, usual depth 0-30m\nThese fish love eating different brown seaweeds. Thus when eaten they have a strong seaweed flavour. The males and females have different colours and markings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongfin Pike\nGrows to 84cm, usual depth 0-60m\nThese fish are often found in large schools of over 100 hundred individuals. However, sometimes they prefer to be more solitary and may be found solo or in pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongsnout Boarfish\nGrows to 50cm, usual depth 4-260m\nBoarfish can often be found hanging out together in small groups under rocky ledges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarblefish\nGrows to 65cm, usual depth 0-40m\nThese fish are abundant in most Tasmanian seaweed reefs. However, they are known to taste highly unpleasant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurple Wrasse\nGrows to 38cm, usual depth 1-90m\nPurple wrasse have powerful jaws and strong teeth that allow them to crush and eat animals like barnacles, crabs and chitons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Rock Crab\nGrows to 7cm (carapace), usual depth 0-8m\nThese crabs have a very hard and tough shell. The shell is made of chitin and has a fine covering of felt in rows upon its legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand Flathead\nGrows to 46cm, usual depth 0-100m\nThe bigger a flathead, the more eggs it produces. In recent years their average size has been decreasing due in part to fishing pressure on large individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Wrasse\nGrows to 23cm, usual depth 0-30m\nThe male of this species has a bright green body, while the female is orange in colour. These fish are curious about SCUBA divers and will often approach them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaws Cowfish\nGrows to 20cm, usual depth 2-200cm\nWhile pretty, these fish are highly poisonous and should never be eaten. Their poison can be released from their skin, and can poison aquariums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Rock Lobster\nGrows to 23cm (carapace), usual depth 1-250m\nThese lobsters (also known as crayfish) often consume sea urchins, which helps protect important native kelp forests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToothbrush Leather Jacket\nGrows to 35cm, usual depth 0-40m\nThis species gets its name from the toothbrush-like bristles the males have on their sides. They can vary largely in colour, with males ranging from yellow to a dark blue-grey as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYellowtail Kingfish\nGrows to 2.5m, usual depth 1-150m\nThese fish are pelagic, which means they can be found out at sea. Individuals from certain regions can be heavily infected with parasitic worms. These worms can alter the flesh when cooked."
