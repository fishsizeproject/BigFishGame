    "text": "Catch or release\nReleasing caught fish, either because they are unwanted or for ocean health (i.e. releasing large breeding females) can reduce the impact of recreational fishing on fish stocks, thus leaving more fish for the future in a healthy ocean. Survival rates of fish featured in the game (such as Yellowtail Kingfish) can be above 85% when released correctly, while flathead survival rates can be about 95%.\nReleasing caught fish can greatly help fish populations. If minimum or maximum size limits are in place, fish too small or too large must be safely released. Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea! All fish that will not be consumed should be released back into the ocean safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high - often over 90%."

Conducting large analyses is important to get more accurate information and knowledge, but collecting large amounts of data can be difficult, time consuming and expensive. In the last decade, science and data collection have undergone a true revolution through citizen science. By creating ways for everyone to get involved and have input into a science project, the knowledge gained and the positive outcomes from research can be greatly amplified and shared with the wider community.\nThe citizen science project Redmap featured on the card stands for Range Extending Database. The research from Redmap involves the collection of marine animal observations from all over Australia and examines how animals are extending their ranges due to warming oceans and changing climates."

Giant kelp forests produce much greater amounts of food for particularly important species of fish and invertebrate than other types of kelp forest, and those species feed back into the larger marine ecosystem.\nHowever, giant kelp forests around Australia have been declining drastically for decades, mostly due to climate change. This is a huge loss of natural underwater “forests” that remains unknown by the general public. Many scientists and organisations are working to restore these kelp forests."

Fishing regulations are essential for sustainable fishing, but in various countries up to 20% of anglers may not obey these rules. This card shows catching fish below or above the determined size limit hurts the population and the fishing, although the damage will naturally depend on how large the overall population is in the fishing spot.\nThrough discarding a card, players can start to understand the overall negative effects of illegal fishing. Fishing rules and regulations are there to protect fish stocks and prevent depletion and over fishing. Not obeying these limits means a less productive and functional marine ecosystem."

    "text": "Large shark\nThe large shark card is present in BigFish to help show the value of apex predators in an ecosystem. Often, large predators are demonised by recreational fishers who mistakenly believe that they are actively predating on fish that could otherwise be caught. In fact, many sharks are primarily scavengers which feed upon sick and old fish, not those usually targeted during recreational fishing. Without large sharks, other food chains will be affected and the ocean can become out of balance.\nSharks also keep species that predate on other important pieces of an ocean ecosystem in check. For example, many of a shark’s prey species eat seaweed, and without sharks to keep the fish population in check seaweed can become scarce. Seaweed is incredibly important in providing some species of juvenile fish with places to hide and live while in a small and vulnerable stage of life."

    "text": "Marine protected area\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) are an important tool for habitat and species conservation. While they are not a standalone solution, they can be used to ensure species and ecosystems survive into the future.\nOne way marine protected areas benefit recreational fishers is that fish from the protected area can “spill over” into neighbouring areas. This works because the breeding stock of large individuals in the marine protected area are safe from fishing and will produce offspring to repopulate fishing spots. Without these protected areas, the big fish will lose protection and have the potential to be caught, so they won’t produce as many offspring for the future.\nThere are many other benefits to marine protected areas and while they need to be used in conjunction with planning and research they are still an important asset to recreational fishers."

Therefore, the science shows that a population of fish is more at risk of decline and slower population recovery when larger individuals of that species are not present.

You can draw these cards from the face-up cards, the deck, or both. This means that you can draw unknown card from the deck or play safe and take what you see (from the face-up cards). Check to see if you have any pink wild cards in your fishing site (not in your hands) - they allow you to draw more cards.\nSPAWN new fish equal to the number of big fish you have in your fishing site. This is done by placing cards from your hand into your fishing site in the larval fish orientation. Check to see if you have any red wild cards in your fishing site (not in your hands) - they allow you to spawn more fish.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the image to zoom in!\n\n\n\nGROW fish to their next stage by rotating them from larval to juvenile, from juvenile to medium, or from medium to big. You can grow a fish to the next stage for every big fish present in your fishing site, i.e. if you have two big fish you may grow two smaller fish to their next stage. Fish can only grow by one stage in each turn (larval to juvenile, medium to large, etc), i.e. larval juvenile cannot become big fish in one round even if you have three big fish and can have three “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green wild cards with a starfish in your fishing hole (not in your hands) – they allow you to grow more fish.\nIf you like, CATCH ONE fish from your fishing site. Catching is optional. You catch fish by placing it in your ice box in the same orientation as you caught it. Caught big fish no longer count as big fish in your fishing site. You can only catch one fish per turn, unless you have orange wild cards in your fishing site (not in your hands), such as fishing rod, scuba equipment or delicious bait. Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching big fish will give you more points, but will reduce the number of cards you can draw, the number of fish you can spawn or the number of growth steps you can have.\nIf you like, play ONE WILD CARD from your hand into your fishing site. Wild cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured cards are played (placed) into your fishing site to give you extra abilities or improve your site. They are permanent and apply each round. Black wildcards give one-off effects and must be discarded once they are played.",

    "text": "Fish cards\n\nThese are all the fish cards included in the standard BigFish game. You can also explore the science behind the wildcards and round-end cards, or learn the rules of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbalone\nGrows to 23cm, usual depth 0-40m\nGreen-lip and Black-lip Abalone are found all around the south east of Australia and are common in Tasmania. Occasionally the two hybridise to create Jade Tiger Abalone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Red Cod\nGrows to 90cm, usual depth 2-115m\nUsually found hiding under rocky ledges during the day, these fish are nocturnal hunters of fishes, crabs and crustaceans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanded Morwong\nGrows to 70cm, usual depth 1-50m\nBanded Morwong can live to 100 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBastard Trumpeter\nGrows to 65cm, usual depth 0-60m\nAs juveniles these fish inhabit shallow coastal reefs for the first few years of life. Currently in Tasmania, they are considered to be depleted, meaning their population is critically low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Fin Tuna\nGrows to 2.2m, usual depth 0-500m\nThese fish are actually endotherms, meaning they can maintain a body temperature that is warmer than the surrounding water, just like mammals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Mackerel\nGrows to 44 cm, usual depth 0-200m\nAs adults, these fish school in great numbers off the coast. However, when young they prefer the protection of inshore habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluethroat Wrasse\nGrows to 50cm, usual depth 1-50m\nThese fish are all born as females and lack a characteristic blue throat. When no males are around, dominant females morph into a male by changing size, shape and colour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrownstriped Leatherjacket\nGrows to 30cm, usual depth 0-20m\nWhilst uncommon around mainland Australia, this leatherjacket can be abundant on Tasmanian seaweed reefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraughtboard Shark\nGrows to 1.5m, usual depth 3-60m\nDraughtboard Sharks are benthic, meaning they spend most of their time on the seafloor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlounder\nGrows to 45cm, usual depth 0-100m\nFlounder are born with eye on either side of their head. When very young, one of these eyes migrates across the head so both eyes are on the same side. This is why flounder have such unusually amazing heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerring Cale\nGrows to 51cm, usual depth 0-30m\nThese fish love eating different brown seaweeds. Thus when eaten they have a strong seaweed flavour. The males and females have different colours and markings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongfin Pike\nGrows to 84cm, usual depth 0-60m\nThese fish are often found in large schools of over 100 hundred individuals. However, sometimes they prefer to be more solitary and may be found solo or in pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongsnout Boarfish\nGrows to 50cm, usual depth 4-260m\nBoarfish can often be found hanging out together in small groups under rocky ledges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarblefish\nGrows to 65cm, usual depth 0-40m\nThese fish are abundant in most Tasmanian seaweed reefs. However, they are known to taste highly unpleasant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurple Wrasse\nGrows to 38cm, usual depth 1-90m\nPurple wrasse have powerful jaws and strong teeth that allow them to crush and eat animals like barnacles, crabs and chitons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Rock Crab\nGrows to 7cm (carapace), usual depth 0-8m\nThese crabs have a very hard and tough shell. The shell is made of chitin and has a fine covering of felt in rows upon its legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand Flathead\nGrows to 46cm, usual depth 0-100m\nThe bigger a flathead, the more eggs it produces. In recent years their average size has been decreasing due in part to fishing pressure on large individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Wrasse\nGrows to 23cm, usual depth 0-30m\nThe male of this species has a bright green body, while the female is orange in colour. These fish are curious about SCUBA divers and will often approach them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaws Cowfish\nGrows to 20cm, usual depth 2-200cm\nWhile pretty, these fish are highly poisonous and should never be eaten. Their poison can be released from their skin, and can poison aquariums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Rock Lobster\nGrows to 23cm (carapace), usual depth 1-250m\nThese lobsters (also known as crayfish) often consume sea urchins, which helps protect important native kelp forests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToothbrush Leather Jacket\nGrows to 35cm, usual depth 0-40m\nThis species gets its name from the toothbrush-like bristles the males have on their sides. They can vary largely in colour, with males ranging from yellow to a dark blue-grey as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYellowtail Kingfish\nGrows to 2.5m, usual depth 1-150m\nThese fish are pelagic, which means they can be found out at sea. Individuals from certain regions can be heavily infected with parasitic worms. These worms can alter the flesh when cooked."

    "text": "El Niño begins\nWhen an El Niño is present on the south east coast of Australia more heatwaves, strong swells and storms affect the ocean. Increases in sea surface temperature can also occur. This can mean smaller individuals of a species are less likely to be able to survive these events. Species such as Abalone have also been observed as having decreased reproductive ability as heatwaves and severe weather cause physiological stress. There is also evidence that fish move away from certain coastal areas, meaning fishing ability is potentially changed in El Niño years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nThis card is revealed at the end of the round. When revealed, each player must discard a medium or juvenile fish from their habitat."

    "section": "Fisheries research occurs",
    "text": "Fisheries research occurs\nFisheries have collapsed in the past, and species have been overcaught to the verge of extinction. This can come as a surprise – there may still be fish being caught, and the fish may appear to be plentiful. In reality we are just getting better at catching them, or the remaining population can reach a critical point beyond which recovery is challenging without intervention. For instance, if most of the breeding population has been fished and the remaining population is being fished too fast, then the individuals left don’t have a chance to reproduce.\nThis is more likely with fish that mature at an old age, such as orange roughy that need to survive 27-32 years before they can reproduce. In the 1980s and 1990s orange roughy were being harvested by fisheries so fast that the fishery collapsed (it was no longer economically viable to harvest these fish as too few were being caught each trip). Without baseline information on how a population is structured in terms of age, size and genetics, we are unable to determine how the population is responding to harvesting by people. With this information however, managers can intervene to save a species and ensure sustainable harvesting into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nDraw a face-down card. If it is a fish card, release it into your fishing spot as a medium sized fish."

    "text": "Localised species extinction\nBiodiversity loss (a decline in the number of species present in an ecosystem) is known to cause the ocean ecosystem to weaken in its ability to adapt and withstand changes. These changes include events such as marine heatwaves, climate change and weather patterns. An ecosystem with lower biodiversity is much more likely to suffer severe negative effects than a more biodiverse and resilient ocean ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nWhen this card is drawn at the end of a round, the subsequent round will have no face-up cards present. This means that all cards that refer to face-up cards will no longer be able to be used during the round where this card is active."

Between 1950 and 2020 the average pH of the ocean shifted from 8.15 to 8.0, meaning it has become more acidic. In more acidic waters, it becomes increasingly difficult for animals to grow their shells and carbonate skeletons."

    "text": "Plankton swarm occurs\nBoth phytoplankton (tiny plants) and the zooplankton (tiny animals) that feed on them are key steps in the food chain of many fish, shellfish, and other marine animals. Like plants, phytoplankton (which are usually microalgae) use sunlight to power chemical reactions that enable them to utilise resources in their environment and grow. This tiny little packages of nutrients are then predated upon by slightly larger (but still small) animals called zooplankton, and eventually fish.\nThe availability of key resources in the environment, mainly nutrients such as iron, is what limits phytoplankton growth. When sudden inputs of these nutrients become available, often the phytoplankton have everything else they need to survive and flourish - sometimes to the extent that phytoplankton blooms cause problems for humans (such as red tides).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player must grow a larval fish into a juvenile fish."

    "text": "Fisheries impose upper size limit\nLarge, old fish often produce disproportionately large numbers of offspring compared to fish of smaller sizes. Larger fish therefore contribute more to the next generation of fish which can be harvested. Protecting large ‘mega-spawners’ results in a greater yield of future fish. A 80 cm snapper produces ~24 times the offspring of a 40 cm snapper (but they both taste just as good!) and releasing the larger fish means more fish next year. In addition to producing disproportionately more young, large fish also connect different populations of fish – ensuring a rich and diverse gene-pool for tackling disease outbreaks and adapting to new conditions. Not all fish are made equal – big fish are more important to fish conservation into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player must spawn a larval fish into their fishing spot."
