    "text": "The game all about fishing in a sustainable way\n\n\nThe Big Fish card game aims to inform and engage everyone interested in fishing or marine conservation through fun play. The main goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future catches. The game is suitable to ages from 10 to 99+ and is best played in a group of 2-5 players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame mechanics\n\n\nBig fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But presence of big fish also allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish for good fishing opportunities. In addition to fishing, other natural and human induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification and others. These events create unpredictability and new challenges and inform about human impacts on aquatic ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nMain messages\n\n\nThis game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about\n\nBig fish are important. They are important for population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are beautiful.\nBig fish are mostly all gone. Commercial and recreational fishing has removed most of the large fish from the ocean, lakes and rivers.\nBig fish can return. Fish grow relatively fast and we take the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their beauty within our lifetimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are we\n\n\nThis game has been developed by the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Sciences (IMAS), University of Tasmania team, led by Matt Testoni, Asta Audzijonyte and Amy Coghlan. All artwork is original and produced by Amy Coghlan (drawings) and Matt Testoni (photos, design). Game testing, advice, interesting facts and many other details have been provided by many researchers, naturalists, students, friends, anglers, divers and game enthusiasts. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nSupporters\n\n\nThis work is supported by a 2020 Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation awarded to Asta Audzijonyte\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our work, adapt the game to your ecosystem, apply the game to your teaching or support our work please contact us at info@fishsizeproject.org"

    "text": "Gameplay\nDuring the round each player follows the steps on the turn order card.\nStep 1. Draw new cards equal to the number of large fish you have in your fishing hole, up to a maximum of 5 cards. These cards can be drawn from the face-up pile or the gameplay deck. This means that a player can either chose some unknown card or play safe and only take cards that they know (from the face-up cards). Check to see if you have any pink wild cards with a clam shell in your fishing hole (not in your hands) - they allow you to draw more cards.\nStep 2. Spawn fish (place them face up in your fishing site) from your hand as a larval fish. Check to see if you have any red wild cards with a dolphin in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to spawn more fish.\nStep 3. Grow fish to their next stage by rotating them from larval to juvenile, from juvenile to medium, or from medium and to big). You can grow a fish to the next stage for every big fish present in your fishing site, i.e. if you have two big fish you may grow to smaller fish to their next stage. Fish can only grow by one stage in each turn (larval to juvenile, medium to large, etc), i.e. larval juvenile cannot become big fish in one round even if you have three big fish and can have three “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green wild cards with a starfish in your fishing hole (not in your hands) – they allow you to grow more fish.\nStep 4. If you like, catch ONE fish from your fishing site. Do this by placing it in your esky in the same orientation as you caught it. Caught large fish no longer count as big fish in your fishing site. Check to see if you have any orange wild cards with a fisher in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to catch more fish (or shellfish). Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching big fish will give you more points, but will reduce the number of cards you can draw, the number of fish you can spawn or the number of growth steps you can have.\nStep 5. If you like, play ONE wild card from your hand. Wild cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured cards are played (placed) into your fishing site to give you extra abilities or improve your site. They are permanent and apply each round. Black wildcards give one-off effects and must be discarded once they are played."

If this is a round 5 or more, the round end card might also be the end of the game card.\nStep 2. Discard cards in your hand so no player has more than 7 cards in hand. This rarely needed, but helps maintain the balance of the game.\nStep 3. Reset the face-up cards for the centre by moving them to the used card pile (face-down) and setting up new face-up cards from the pile (number of players + 2).\nStep 4. Rotate the first player by passing the first player card clockwise. This ensures that the first player gets the choice of new face-up cards equally."

Each larval, juvenile and medium fish remaining in your fishing site give you 1 point. Add these points to your total score. This encourages to keep a healthy ecosystem.\nStep 3. Each big fish remaining alive in your fishing site give you 2 points. Add these points to your total score. This encourages to keep a healthy ecosystem and large fish for the future.\nThe winner is the player with the most points!"
