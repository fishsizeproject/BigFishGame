    "text": "The game all about fishing in a sustainable way\n\n\nThe Big Fish card game aims to inform and engage everyone interested in fishing or marine conservation through fun play. The main goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future catches. The game is suitable to ages from 10 to 99+ and is best played in a group of 2-5 players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame mechanics\n\n\nBig fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But presence of big fish also allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish for good fishing opportunities. In addition to fishing, other natural and human induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification and others. These events create unpredictability and new challenges and inform about human impacts on aquatic ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nMain messages\n\n\nThis game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about\n\nBig fish are important. They are important for population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are beautiful.\nBig fish are mostly all gone. Commercial and recreational fishing has removed most of the large fish from the ocean, lakes and rivers.\nBig fish can return. Fish grow relatively fast and we take the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their beauty within our lifetimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are we\n\n\nThis game has been developed by the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Sciences (IMAS), University of Tasmania team, led by Matt Testoni, Asta Audzijonyte and Amy Coghlan. All artwork is original and produced by Amy Coghlan (drawings) and Matt Testoni (photos, design). Game testing, advice, interesting facts and many other details have been provided by many researchers, naturalists, students, friends, anglers, divers and game enthusiasts. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nSupporters\n\n\nThis work is supported by a 2020 Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation awarded to Asta Audzijonyte\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our work, adapt the game to your ecosystem, apply the game to your teaching or support our work please contact us at info@fishsizeproject.org"

Shuffle the remaining round end cards. Lift the top four round end cards and put them aside. Put the “End of game card” with the remaining round end cards and shuffle them again. Place the four round end cards on top and put the pile near the centre. The goal is to have the game end randomly at any time after the first four rounds.\nIdentify a large clear space in front of each player as their fishing spot. Deal each player 5 starting cards from the gameplay deck.At the start of the game each player places up to 3 fish from their hand into their fishing site: one as a big fish, one as a medium fish and one juvenile fish. If the player does not have 3 fish in their hand, they place fewer cards (big and medium or only one big fish).\nFrom the gameplay deck flip over cards equal to the number of players plus 2 additional card and place them in the middle next to the gameplay deck. These are the face-up cards. Give each player an esky card, this is placed below the fishing hole. Remember fish placed in the esky must maintain their orientation (juvenile, medium, big). Chose the first player for the first round. It could be the one to most recently have caught a fish."

    "text": "Gameplay\nDuring the round each player follows the steps on the turn order card.\nStep 1. Draw new cards equal to the number of large fish you have in your fishing hole, up to a maximum of 5 cards. These cards can be drawn from the face-up pile or the gameplay deck. This means that a player can either chose some unknown card or play safe and only take cards that they know (from the face-up cards). Check to see if you have any pink wild cards with a clam shell in your fishing hole (not in your hands) - they allow you to draw more cards.\nStep 2. Spawn fish (place them face up in your fishing site) from your hand as a larval fish. Check to see if you have any red wild cards with a dolphin in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to spawn more fish.\nStep 3. Grow fish to their next stage by rotating them from larval to juvenile, from juvenile to medium, or from medium and to big). You can grow a fish to the next stage for every big fish present in your fishing site, i.e. if you have two big fish you may grow to smaller fish to their next stage. Fish can only grow by one stage in each turn (larval to juvenile, medium to large, etc), i.e. larval juvenile cannot become big fish in one round even if you have three big fish and can have three “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green wild cards with a starfish in your fishing hole (not in your hands) – they allow you to grow more fish.\nStep 4. If you like, catch ONE fish from your fishing site. Do this by placing it in your esky in the same orientation as you caught it. Caught large fish no longer count as big fish in your fishing site. Check to see if you have any orange wild cards with a fisher in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to catch more fish (or shellfish). Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching big fish will give you more points, but will reduce the number of cards you can draw, the number of fish you can spawn or the number of growth steps you can have.\nStep 5. If you like, play ONE wild card from your hand. Wild cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured cards are played (placed) into your fishing site to give you extra abilities or improve your site. They are permanent and apply each round. Black wildcards give one-off effects and must be discarded once they are played."

If this is a round 5 or more, the round end card might also be the end of the game card.\nStep 2. Discard cards in your hand so no player has more than 7 cards in hand. This rarely needed, but helps maintain the balance of the game.\nStep 3. Reset the face-up cards for the centre by moving them to the used card pile (face-down) and setting up new face-up cards from the pile (number of players + 2).\nStep 4. Rotate the first player by passing the first player card clockwise. This ensures that the first player gets the choice of new face-up cards equally."

Each larval, juvenile and medium fish remaining in your fishing site give you 1 point. Add these points to your total score. This encourages to keep a healthy ecosystem.\nStep 3. Each big fish remaining alive in your fishing site give you 2 points. Add these points to your total score. This encourages to keep a healthy ecosystem and large fish for the future.\nThe winner is the player with the most points!"

    "text": "Wild cards\n\nCatch and release\nReleasing caught fish can greatly help fish populations. One must safely release fish that is too small or too large for the size limits (if minimum or maximum size limits are in place). Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea, so all fish that will not be consumed should be released back safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high, e.g. over 90% or even higher.\nHow to play? Choose a fish from the available face-up cards and either place it in your esky (cooler) or release it into your fishing spot. The size of the fish to be released will be mentioned on the card, and different cards have different sizes. Remember this card is discarded after use.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nLearn how to release fish safely in this video with Steve Starling:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Keep Fish Wet” is a great organisation in the USA, working with anglers to increase survival in catch and release fishing. They have three main rules to ensure released fish have good chances to survive.\nYou can also learn about catch and release fishing from Australia’s great angler organisation OzFish.\nHere is a great site with information on catch and release survival rates for different NSW fish species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentre for Marine Socioecology (CMS)\nThe Centre for Marine Socioecology (CMS) provides, develops and integrates multidisciplinary research to better understand and manage Australia’s oceans. They do this by connecting, cooperating and collaborating across multiple organisations and different research disciplines. Their members range from marine scientists to philosophers, artists, economists and more. Collaborative work across diverse disciplines is often hard to achieve but is extremely important when tackling complex sustainability challenges. The CMS card in Big Fish aims to highlight how working together produces broad and wide reaching benefits for everyone.\nHow to play? Draw two cards from the face-down card pile and put them in your hand. Then choose another player to draw one card from the face-down card pile that they will keep in their hand. Remember this card is discarded after use.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nCheck out some of the amazing CMS initiatives, such as Curious Climate Schools, where all schools can join in to ask experts questions about climate change.\nCheck out also this Future Seas 2030 initiative, where a large group of researchers aimed to envision two alternative ocean futures for 2030. We can have a Business as usual or Sustainable and collaborative future. Which one do we chose? Don’t forget to watch this fun thriller Full metal aquatic on how the two futures might play out.\nWhy do we need to collaborate? Read more about it here\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizen science\nIn the last decade, science and data collection have undergone a true revolution through what is called as citizen science. Collecting enough data or conducting large analyses is important in order to get more accurate information and knowledge. However, collecting large amounts of data can be difficult, time consuming and expensive. By creating ways for everyone to get involved and have input into a science project, the knowledge gained and the positive outcomes from research can be greatly amplified and shared with the wider community.\nHow to play? Choose a fish card currently in your hand and place it as a big fish into your fishing spot. Remember this card is discarded after use.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nThere are plenty of citizen science initiatives for everyone to get involved into. Here are some examples:\nRedMap\niNaturalist\nOceanwatch Australia\nReef Life Survey\nTassie Fish Frame Collection Program\n\n\n\nCitizen scientist helping with underwater surveys in the Reef Life Survey program. Photo credit: Rick Stuart-Smith, reeflifesurvey.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiant kelp\nKelp provides a huge, complex, and food filled habitat. It is essential for healthy oceans and healthy fish populations and it also serves as an important refuge for marine organisms. However, giant kelp around Australia has declined drastically over the last decades, with nearly 95% of kelp around Tasmania lost. This is mostly due to climate change and invasion of long-spined sea urchins, who eat a lot of kelp and create urchin barrens. Loss of natural urchin predators, such as large rock lobsters and other large predatory fish, is one of the reasons for kelp decline, and kelp forests often survive better in no-take marine protected areas with abundant urchin predators. This huge loss of natural underwater “forests” remains largely unknown by the general public. Many scientists and organisations are working to restore these kelp forests and we all can play a role by protecting rock lobsters and aiming to restore the abundance of large lobsters and other large fish.\nHow to play? If you have a Giant Kelp card in your fishing spot you may grow two larval fish into juvenile fish each turn. The rule of one grow increment per fish per turn still applies.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nGuardian article about kelp forest loss and restoration.\nWatch these videos about giant kelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about giant kelp restoration efforts by IMAS, OzFish and The Nature Conservancy\nOr read a scientific article about reasons for kelp decline and restoration efforts.\n\n\n\nHealthy giant kelp.

Known as whale pumps, these animals help by feeding in the deep oceans and pooping out large quantities of nutrients in shallow waters. These nutrients are essential for smaller species such as phytoplankton to grow. Many whale populations have been decimated by whaling, but populations of humpback whales have recovered in the last decades. This wild card shows how a visiting whale can provide positive impacts on a local environment. While they may consume some krill or small fish for food they also supply vital nutrients that are required for a healthy marine habitat and good fishing.\nHow to play? Discard a larval or juvenile fish from your fishing spot to grow a medium fish to a big fish. One grow per fish per turn still applies. Remember this card is discarded after use.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nA scientific article explaining the benefits of the “whale pump”.\nA story about the investigation of the whale nutrient pump.\nA popular article about great whales, threats and actions that can be taken to prevent them (with a focus on Canada).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllegal fishing\nIllegal fishing means fishing that does not follow existing regulations, be they minimum or maximum size limits, bag limits, marine protected areas or other rules. Fishing regulations are essential for sustainable fishing, but in various countries up to 20% of anglers may not obey these rules. This card shows catching fish below or above the determined size limit hurts the population and the fishing, although the damage will naturally depend on how large the overall population is in the fishing spot.\nHow to play? Choose a player, they must choose two juvenile fish from their fishing spot and discard them (juvenile fish are below the minimum size limit and should not be fished). Remember this card is discarded after use.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nFishwatch allows you to report illegal fishing in Tasmania.\nA scientific article about illegal fishing (not recreational) and societal well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge shark\n\n\nMarine protected area\n\n\nPoor water quality\n\n\nSeaweed\n\n\nSevere weather\n\n\nShelfish reef"
