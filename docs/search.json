Such changes to the natural fish population size structure impact fish population and ecosystem resilience. However, most fish populations are not assessed and humans impacts of fish size diversity loss remain undocumented.  We are using traditional and new sources of fish size data to understand how many small and large fish we should expect in natural populations, how fishing and warming are affecting these numbers and how we could restore what is lost."

    "text": "Research\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of intra-specific size distributions\nAre there general rules that govern species size distributions in natural populations? If so, we could use these rules to predict unfished size frequencies in nearly all fish species.\nTo date most analyses on fish size frequencies were conducted on commercially fished species, where fishing impacts have been extensive and long lasting. But new data sources, from underwater visual surveys, such as Reef Life Survey now provides opporunities to explore size distributions in hundreds of diverse and unfished species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature impacts on fish sizes\nTemperature affects fish sizes, both naturally and through human induced climate change. Growth, mortality, reproduction and species composition are all affected by temperature. But what are the mechanisms and how do these temperature impacts manifest in natural populations, through space and time?\nWe use diverse data sources and simulations to explore temperature impacts on fish growth, size structure and population dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying size based models to assess human impacts\nSize based models are a powerful tool to assess human impacts on fish populations. Traditionally these methods are used with catch data, but rapid accumulation of alternative data sources, such as visual census, citizen science, recreational fishing and underwater cameras, provide an opportunity to expand assessments across hundreds of fish species.\nWe are exploring best approaches to improve applications of size based population and community models to document human impacts in data poor fisheries and aquatic ecosystems in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing historical records to understand shifting baselines\nHistorical records, such as old newspapers, logbooks, photos and archival records can provide valuable information about status of fish populations before detailed surveys began. These records are crucial to improve our understanding about natural fish sizes and address shifting baselines.\nWe are working with researches around the world to find new ways to use historical data in fish population assessments."

One must safely release fish that is too small or too large for the size limits (if minimum or maximum size limits are in place). Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea, so all fish that will not be consumed should be released back safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high, e.g. over 90% or even higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a fish from the available face-up cards and either place it in your esky (cooler) or release it into your fishing spot.

It is essential for healthy oceans and healthy fish populations and it also serves as an important refuge for marine organisms. However, giant kelp around Australia has declined drastically over the last decades, with nearly 95% of kelp around Tasmania lost. This is mostly due to climate change and invasion of long-spined sea urchins, who eat a lot of kelp and create urchin barrens. Loss of natural urchin predators, such as large rock lobsters and other large predatory fish, is one of the reasons for kelp decline, and kelp forests often survive better in no-take marine protected areas with abundant urchin predators. This huge loss of natural underwater “forests” remains largely unknown by the general public. Many scientists and organisations are working to restore these kelp forests and we all can play a role by protecting rock lobsters and aiming to restore the abundance of large lobsters and other large fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a Giant Kelp card in your fishing spot you may grow two larval fish into juvenile fish each turn.

    "text": "Game mechanics\nBig fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted to catch them. But presence of big fish also allows players to draw new cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish for good fishing opportunities. In addition to fishing, other natural and human induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean acidification and others. These events create unpredictability and new challenges and inform about human impacts on aquatic ecosystems."

Shuffle the remaining round end cards. Lift the top four round end cards and put them aside. Put the “End of game card” with the remaining round end cards and shuffle them again. Place the four round end cards on top and put the pile near the centre. The goal is to have the game end randomly at any time after the first four rounds.\nIdentify a large clear space in front of each player as their fishing spot. Deal each player 5 starting cards from the gameplay deck.At the start of the game each player places up to 3 fish from their hand into their fishing site: one as a big fish, one as a medium fish and one juvenile fish. If the player does not have 3 fish in their hand, they place fewer cards (big and medium or only one big fish).\nFrom the gameplay deck flip over cards equal to the number of players plus 2 additional card and place them in the middle next to the gameplay deck. These are the face-up cards. Give each player an esky card, this is placed below the fishing hole. Remember fish placed in the esky must maintain their orientation (juvenile, medium, big). Chose the first player for the first round. It could be the one to most recently have caught a fish.",

    "text": "Gameplay\nDuring the round each player follows the steps on the turn order card.\nStep 1. Draw new cards equal to the number of large fish you have in your fishing hole, up to a maximum of 5 cards. These cards can be drawn from the face-up pile or the gameplay deck. This means that a player can either chose some unknown card or play safe and only take cards that they know (from the face-up cards). Check to see if you have any pink wild cards with a clam shell in your fishing hole (not in your hands) - they allow you to draw more cards.\nStep 2. Spawn fish (place them face up in your fishing site) from your hand as a larval fish. Check to see if you have any red wild cards with a dolphin in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to spawn more fish.\nStep 3. Grow fish to their next stage by rotating them from larval to juvenile, from juvenile to medium, or from medium and to big). You can grow a fish to the next stage for every big fish present in your fishing site, i.e. if you have two big fish you may grow to smaller fish to their next stage. Fish can only grow by one stage in each turn (larval to juvenile, medium to large, etc), i.e. larval juvenile cannot become big fish in one round even if you have three big fish and can have three “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green wild cards with a starfish in your fishing hole (not in your hands) – they allow you to grow more fish.\nStep 4. If you like, catch ONE fish from your fishing site. Do this by placing it in your esky in the same orientation as you caught it. Caught large fish no longer count as big fish in your fishing site. Check to see if you have any orange wild cards with a fisher in your fishing site (not in your hands) – they allow you to catch more fish (or shellfish). Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching big fish will give you more points, but will reduce the number of cards you can draw, the number of fish you can spawn or the number of growth steps you can have.\nStep 5. If you like, play ONE wild card from your hand. Wild cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured cards are played (placed) into your fishing site to give you extra abilities or improve your site. They are permanent and apply each round. Black wildcards give one-off effects and must be discarded once they are played.",

If this is a round 5 or more, the round end card might also be the end of the game card.\nStep 2. Discard cards in your hand so no player has more than 7 cards in hand. This rarely needed, but helps maintain the balance of the game.\nStep 3. Reset the face-up cards for the centre by moving them to the used card pile (face-down) and setting up new face-up cards from the pile (number of players + 2).\nStep 4. Rotate the first player by passing the first player card clockwise. This ensures that the first player gets the choice of new face-up cards equally.",

Each larval, juvenile and medium fish remaining in your fishing site give you 1 point. Add these points to your total score. This encourages to keep a healthy ecosystem.\nStep 3. Each big fish remaining alive in your fishing site give you 2 points. Add these points to your total score. This encourages to keep a healthy ecosystem and large fish for the future.\nThe winner is the player with the most points!",
