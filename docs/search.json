Survival rates of fish featured in the game (such as Yellowtail Kingfish) can be above 85% when released correctly, while flathead survival rates can be about 95%.\nReleasing caught fish can greatly help fish populations. If minimum or maximum size limits are in place, fish too small or too large must be safely released. Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea! All fish that will not be consumed should be released back into the ocean safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high - often over 90%."

Often, large predators are demonised by recreational fishers who mistakenly believe that they are actively predating on fish that could otherwise be caught. In fact, many sharks are primarily scavengers which feed upon sick and old fish, not those usually targeted during recreational fishing. Without large sharks, other food chains will be affected and the ocean can become out of balance.\nSharks also keep species that predate on other important pieces of an ocean ecosystem in check. For example, many of a shark’s prey species eat seaweed, and without sharks to keep the fish population in check seaweed can become scarce. Seaweed is incredibly important in providing some species of juvenile fish with places to hide and live while in a small and vulnerable stage of life."

While they are not a standalone solution, they can be used to ensure species and ecosystems survive into the future.\nOne way marine protected areas benefit recreational fishers is that fish from the protected area can “spill over” into neighbouring areas. This works because the breeding stock of large individuals in the marine protected area are safe from fishing and will produce offspring to repopulate fishing spots. Without these protected areas, the big fish will lose protection and have the potential to be caught, so they won’t produce as many offspring for the future.\nThere are many other benefits to marine protected areas and while they need to be used in conjunction with planning and research they are still an important asset to recreational fishers."

Check to see if you have any orange Draw Wild Cards in your Fishing Spot (not in your Hand) - these allow you to Draw extra cards.\nSPAWN new fish equal to the number of Big Fish you have in your Fishing Spot.

Grow fish to their next stage by rotating them from Larval to Juvenile, from Juvenile to Medium, or from Medium to Big. Fish can only Grow by 1 size each turn (Larval to Juvenile, Medium to Big, etc), i.e. Larval and Juvenile Fish cannot become Big Fish in one round even if you have 3 Big Fish and can have 3 “growth steps”. Check to see if you have any green Wild Cards in your Fishing Spot (not in your Hand) – these allow you to Grow more fish.\nIf you like, CATCH ONE 1 fish from your Fishing Spot. Catching is optional. You Catch fish by moving the fish from your Fishing Spot into your Ice Box whilst making sure the orientation (size) doesn’t change. Caught Big Fish no longer count as Big Fish in your Fishing Spot. Remember you can only Catch 1 fish per turn, unless you have yellow Wild Cards in your Fishing Spot (not in your Hand), such as fishing rod, SCUBA equipment or delicious bait. Remember, it is important to keep catching fish, because once the game ends the player who has the largest number of points from the caught fish will win. Catching Big Fish will give you more points, however, it will reduce the number of cards you can Draw, the number of fish you can Spawn or the number of Grow steps you can perform.\nIf you like, PLAY 1 Wild Card from your Hand into your Fishing Spot. Wild Cards come in multiple colours that do different things. Coloured Wild Cards are played (placed) into your Fishing Spot to give you extra abilities or improve your Fishing Spot (these abilities activate on the player’s next turn during each corresponding turn step).

This can come as a surprise – there may still be fish being caught, and the fish may appear to be plentiful. In reality we are just getting better at catching them, or the remaining population can reach a critical point beyond which recovery is challenging without intervention. For instance, if most of the breeding population has been fished and the remaining population is being fished too fast, then the individuals left don’t have a chance to reproduce.\nThis is more likely with fish that mature at an old age, such as orange roughy that need to survive 27-32 years before they can reproduce. In the 1980s and 1990s orange roughy were being harvested by fisheries so fast that the fishery collapsed (it was no longer economically viable to harvest these fish as too few were being caught each trip). Without baseline information on how a population is structured in terms of age, size and genetics, we are unable to determine how the population is responding to harvesting by people. With this information however, managers can intervene to save a species and ensure sustainable harvesting into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nDraw a face-down card.

Therefore, a healthy seaweed ecosystem restored into the correct habitat will help return and maintain healthy fish stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nPlace a Seaweed or Giant Kelp card from your hand into your fishing spot."

    "section": "Fisheries impose upper size limit",
    "text": "Fisheries impose upper size limit\nLarge, old fish often produce disproportionately large numbers of offspring compared to fish of smaller sizes. Larger fish therefore contribute more to the next generation of fish which can be harvested. Protecting large ‘mega-spawners’ results in a greater yield of future fish. A 80 cm snapper produces ~24 times the offspring of a 40 cm snapper (but they both taste just as good!) and releasing the larger fish means more fish next year. In addition to producing disproportionately more young, large fish also connect different populations of fish – ensuring a rich and diverse gene-pool for tackling disease outbreaks and adapting to new conditions. Not all fish are made equal – big fish are more important to fish conservation into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player must spawn a larval fish into their fishing spot."

    "text": "Long spined sea urchins arrive\nLong Spined Sea Urchins have arrived in Tasmania as a range shifting specie due to warming waters induced by climate change. These urchins have been creating vast barrens on the seafloor over the last few decades. Barrens are areas that have been grazed by urchins and often consist of nothing but barren rock. This means that the habitat for many scale fish have been degraded and destroyed. Barrens can often be prevented by having an abundant number of adults marine species such as lobsters and gropers along with a commercial urchin fishery.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player must discard all Seaweed and Giant Kelp cards from their fishing spot."

You can also explore the science behind the wildcards and event cards, or learn the rules of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbalone\nGrows to 23cm, usual depth 0-40m\nGreen-lip and Black-lip Abalone are found all around the south east of Australia and are common in Tasmania. Occasionally the two hybridise to create Jade Tiger Abalone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Red Cod\nGrows to 90cm, usual depth 2-115m\nUsually found hiding under rocky ledges during the day, these fish are nocturnal hunters of fishes, crabs and crustaceans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanded Morwong\nGrows to 70cm, usual depth 1-50m\nBanded Morwong can live to 100 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBastard Trumpeter\nGrows to 65cm, usual depth 0-60m\nAs juveniles these fish inhabit shallow coastal reefs for the first few years of life. Currently in Tasmania, they are considered to be depleted, meaning their population is critically low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Fin Tuna\nGrows to 2.2m, usual depth 0-500m\nThese fish are actually endotherms, meaning they can maintain a body temperature that is warmer than the surrounding water, just like mammals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Mackerel\nGrows to 44 cm, usual depth 0-200m\nAs adults, these fish school in great numbers off the coast. However, when young they prefer the protection of inshore habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluethroat Wrasse\nGrows to 50cm, usual depth 1-50m\nThese fish are all born as females and lack a characteristic blue throat. When no males are around, dominant females morph into a male by changing size, shape and colour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrownstriped Leatherjacket\nGrows to 30cm, usual depth 0-20m\nWhilst uncommon around mainland Australia, this leatherjacket can be abundant on Tasmanian seaweed reefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraughtboard Shark\nGrows to 1.5m, usual depth 3-60m\nDraughtboard Sharks are benthic, meaning they spend most of their time on the seafloor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlounder\nGrows to 45cm, usual depth 0-100m\nFlounder are born with eye on either side of their head. When very young, one of these eyes migrates across the head so both eyes are on the same side. This is why flounder have such unusually amazing heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerring Cale\nGrows to 51cm, usual depth 0-30m\nThese fish love eating different brown seaweeds. Thus when eaten they have a strong seaweed flavour. The males and females have different colours and markings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongfin Pike\nGrows to 84cm, usual depth 0-60m\nThese fish are often found in large schools of over 100 hundred individuals. However, sometimes they prefer to be more solitary and may be found solo or in pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongsnout Boarfish\nGrows to 50cm, usual depth 4-260m\nBoarfish can often be found hanging out together in small groups under rocky ledges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarblefish\nGrows to 65cm, usual depth 0-40m\nThese fish are abundant in most Tasmanian seaweed reefs. However, they are known to taste highly unpleasant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurple Wrasse\nGrows to 38cm, usual depth 1-90m\nPurple wrasse have powerful jaws and strong teeth that allow them to crush and eat animals like barnacles, crabs and chitons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Rock Crab\nGrows to 7cm (carapace), usual depth 0-8m\nThese crabs have a very hard and tough shell. The shell is made of chitin and has a fine covering of felt in rows upon its legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand Flathead\nGrows to 46cm, usual depth 0-100m\nThe bigger a flathead, the more eggs it produces. In recent years their average size has been decreasing due in part to fishing pressure on large individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Wrasse\nGrows to 23cm, usual depth 0-30m\nThe male of this species has a bright green body, while the female is orange in colour. These fish are curious about SCUBA divers and will often approach them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaws Cowfish\nGrows to 20cm, usual depth 2-200cm\nWhile pretty, these fish are highly poisonous and should never be eaten. Their poison can be released from their skin, and can poison aquariums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Rock Lobster\nGrows to 23cm (carapace), usual depth 1-250m\nThese lobsters (also known as crayfish) often consume sea urchins, which helps protect important native kelp forests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToothbrush Leather Jacket\nGrows to 35cm, usual depth 0-40m\nThis species gets its name from the toothbrush-like bristles the males have on their sides. They can vary largely in colour, with males ranging from yellow to a dark blue-grey as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYellowtail Kingfish\nGrows to 2.5m, usual depth 1-150m\nThese fish are pelagic, which means they can be found out at sea. Individuals from certain regions can be heavily infected with parasitic worms. These worms can alter the flesh when cooked."

They are a range shifting species.\nLong-spined sea urchins have become a dominant herbivore (plant-eating animal), which has destroyed underwater seaweed or kelp forests that are key habitats for many Tasmanian fish species.\nLong-spined sea urchin predators are primarily the southern rock lobster. Yet, lobster abundance is very low due to recreational and commercial fishing. Simply speaking, lobsters are overfished and cannot control urchins.\nOnly larger rock lobsters are able to consume long-spined sea urchins.\nOnce urchins eat all the seaweed and form an “urchin barren” it is very hard and slow to restore the kelp forests back, unless all urchins are removed.\nOver the last few decades, nearly 90% of Tasmanian kelp forests have been lost. This has devastating impacts on Tasmanian seafood industry, especially abalone harvests. Tasmanian government is supporting an urchin harvest industry with the goal of artificially reducing urchin numbers.\nTo control urchin numbers it is essential to restore southern rock lobster populations.\n\nThe lesson introduces UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”\n\n\n\nLearning intention\nStudents use the Big Fish game (as a simulation) to model a trophic cascade on temperate rocky reefs:\n\nSeaweed or kelp = habitat and primary producer\nLong-spined sea urchins = grazer that can remove kelp and create “barrens”\nRock lobsters = predator that can reduce urchin numbers and grazing pressure\n\nReal-world context: long-spined urchins have expanded into Tasmania and are having large negative impact on Tasmanian seafood industry and ecosystems.\n\n\nSuccess criteria\nBy the end of the lesson and assessment, students can:\n\nDraw a simple food web for kelp–urchin–lobster and label energy flow.\nExplain, with evidence from their game data, what happens when lobster numbers drop.\nPropose one management response (e.g., protection of predators, urchin harvest), explain their costs and benefits and justify them."

Tasmanian government is supporting an urchin harvest industry with the goal of artificially reducing urchin numbers.\nTo control urchin numbers it is essential to restore southern rock lobster populations.\n\nThe lesson introduces UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”\nThis lesson targets the Australian Science Curriculum Biological sciences focus on interdependence and interactions within ecosystems and how biological systems respond to change. “Ecosystems consist of communities of interdependent organisms… matter and energy flow…” ACSSU176\n\n\n\nLearning intention\nStudents use the Big Fish game (as a simulation) to model a trophic cascade on temperate rocky reefs:\n\nSeaweed or kelp = habitat and primary producer\nLong-spined sea urchins = grazer that can remove kelp and create “barrens”\nRock lobsters = predator that can reduce urchin numbers and grazing pressure\n\nReal-world context: long-spined urchins have expanded into Tasmania and are having large negative impact on Tasmanian seafood industry and ecosystems.\n\n\nSuccess criteria\nBy the end of the lesson and assessment, students can:\n\nDraw a simple food web for kelp–urchin–lobster and label energy flow.\nExplain, with evidence from their game data, what happens when lobster numbers drop.\nPropose one management response (e.g., protection of predators, urchin harvest), explain their costs and benefits and justify them."

    "text": "Core concepts\n\nMany marine ecosystems have been degraded and affected by overfishing, pollution and climate change. It is estimated that almost 90% of all fish larger than 1kg in size have been lost due to unsustainable fishing practices.\nMany fisheries in Australia and globally have collapsed, meaning that fish population biomass (total weight of all the fish in a population) has been reduced to less than 10% of their original unfished biomass. Such collapsed fisheries cannot sustain any more fishing.\nBy allowing degraded ecosystems and collapsed populations to recover we can bring back abundant fisheries and healthy thriving oceans.\nIn this lesson students start with a “degraded ecosystem” as their fishing spot. This ecosystem only has a few fish left.\nStudents then explore best options to restore the ecosystem, while at the same time managing unpredictable weather events and illegal behaviour by other people.\nExample strategies of restoring ecosystems include the construction of shellfish reefs, the implementation of marine parks, improved fishing regulations, or seaweed (kelp) restoration.\nBy protecting big fish and implementing management strategies students discover that marine ecosystems can recover relatively fast.\n\nThe lesson introduces UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”\nThis lesson targets the Australian Science Curriculum Biological sciences focus on interdependence and interactions within ecosystems and how biological systems respond to change. “Ecosystems consist of communities of interdependent organisms… matter and energy flow…” ACSSU176\n\n\n\nLearning intention\nStudents use the Big Fish game (as a simulation) to model strategies for ecosystem restoration in Australian temperate reefs:\n\nSeaweed, Marine Parks, Shellfish Reefs, Sharks = possible strategies for restoring ecosystems include Wild cards such as\nHeat Waves and Illegal Fishing = threats to restoration include. Students need to consider these events when planning and strategising the restoration.\n\nReal-world context: Real-world context: ecosystems such as the D’Entrecasteaux Channel in Tasmania, Port Phillip Bay in Victoria and areas of South Australia (affected by the recent algal bloom) are a shadow of their former health. But good management and right strategies can help restore them to productive and healthy ocean ecosystems.\n\n\nSuccess criteria\nBy the end of the lesson and assessment, students can:\n\nTest and understand restoration strategies. Student use the Big Fish card game as a model to explore different strategies but are also able to connect it to real world events.\nExplain (with evidence from the game and real world) the way different restoration options work and how they can interact with other options and the ecosystem in general.\nPropose a plan for restoring a degraded marine ecosystem. Provide evidence and examples of how effective the proposed strategies have been in the past, including the successes and failures."

The brief outlines a clear strategy for ecosystem restoration to address the selected environmental issue that the Minister wants to fix. You can download the template for the assessment here\n2) (optional) present the ministerial brief in an oral presentation. To make this more interactive, all students in the class get allocated $500 of “monopoly” money or other fake bills each. Each student give their money to the restoration projects they liked most.\n3) (optional) present the mind-map illustrating the though process, explaining positives and negatives of each restoration option and how it affects other species and society.\nTips\n\nEnsure this brief has correct and clear information to be as accurate as possible, while also being short and focused.\nThe brief should contain both the negatives and positives that will arise from implementing the restoration plan. Remember, the brief is used to inform the minister, not to push for a specific action. The minister is already interested in restoring the ecosystem, but they just need to decide on the best option.\nIt can be useful to look at all the Event and Wild cards in the full Big Fish card game and its expansion to understand more options for restoration.\nFor a more advanced assessment, students could present several potential plans (which perhaps have been discussed in media) and rank them from best to worst, based on their analysis. For example, marine parks will provide more fish but can have negative press, building shellfish reefs may cost a lot of money but will be popular with people, an education program (i.e. a game about how sharks produce a healthy ecosystem) will be popular but may be less effective.\nThe brief should also stakeholder concerns, not just the core science. For example, if ecosystem is overfished the concern in society is that there is not enough fish to catch or see. Remember that the minister responds to society pressure mostly.\nThe mind-map can show their thought process for the development of restoration plan. It can included references to the scenarios from the Big Fish card game and other resources provided in this lesson or discovered by students. This would be like demonstrating the working out process in a maths question."

    "section": "Core concepts",
    "text": "Core concepts\n\nThe lesson builds upon the previous lesson (2: Ecosystem restoration) but introduces more realism and challenges to ecosystems due to changing climate. The game includes more events associated with a changing climate, such as Ocean Acidification, Long Spine Sea Urchin Arrive and El Niño. These events are occurring more frequently in real world and they interfere with ecosystem restoration attempts.\nAs before, students start with a degraded ecosystem whereby only a few fish are present. This is representative of many current marine ecosystems which have been severely depleted and affected.\nStudents aim to rebuild the ecosystem by increasing fish abundances, sizes and diversity. But this time the students need to foresee potential events that will affect their restoration and manage their ecosystem accordingly.\nBy looking after big fish and implementing management strategies, preparing for the future and adapting management policies, students learn how to ensure that marine ecosystems are more resilient to future challenges. The lesson teaches concepts that will be essential in ensuring a healthy ocean into the future.\n\nThe lesson introduces UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”\n\n\n\nLearning intention\nStudents use the Big Fish game (as a simulation) to model adaption policies and marine management to create more resilient marine ecosystems while also providing the same or increased community and environmental benefits.\n\nOcean Acidification = shows how certain species will become less abundant in our marine environments due to changing ocean pH (acidity) and what the lose of these species will mean. It provides insights into how we will need to manage these losses in the future.\nLong Spined Sea Urchins Arrive = these cards show the cascading impacts that “range-shifting” species can have on marine ecosystems. They highlight the expected decline in ecosystem health, alongside the loss of a key management option. When paired with the Ocean Acidification card, students can see how pressures that seem separate can combine to create bigger, compounding effects. The scenario also makes it clear how the presence or absence of management tools changes how well an ecosystem can adapt and build resilience to climate change, while giving students early clues about practical ways to respond.\nEl Niño Begins = this card helps students see how a warming climate can shift weather patterns and trigger flow-on effects through marine ecosystems. It also points to a practical resilience lever: protecting big fish. When big fish are conserved, they remain a management option that can make the ecosystem more resilient. When big fish are fished out, the ecosystem becomes less resilient and recover from climate events is slow or non-existent.\n\nReal-world context: Most Australian and global marine ecosystems are affected by multiple pressures at the same time. To adapt to climate change impacts we need to manage ecosystems for resilience and health.\n\n\nSuccess criteria\nBy the end of the lesson and assessment, students can:\n\nTest and evaluate management options that build resilient marine ecosystems.\nExplain how society and managers should adapt their management policies and strategies, how these adaptation work, how different positive and negative actions interact, and how these interactions shape the ecosystem as a whole.\nPropose a practical plan to make a local marine ecosystem more resilient to climate-driven changes. The plan must be supported by evidence and real-world examples that highlight both successes and limitations."

To learn about the rules of the typical Big Fish game, you can visit the rules page on the Big Fish card game website. The only difference to the standard game is in how the Event deck (end of round cards) is set up.\nFor the Event deck, use the three hard mode Event cards (indicated by the black bag icon atop the right side of the card). These are the El Niño Begins, Ocean Acidification and Long Spined Sea Urchins Arrive. Note, same cards also exist in non-hard mode, so replace them with the hard mode version.\nAdd in the Fisheries Impose Upper Size Limit and if you have the expansion card set also add the Algal Bloom and Jellyfish event cards. Shuffle these Event cards, then place the Fishing Season Closed card on the bottom on the deck. 5 rounds works well so if using the expansion consider using only 5 Event cards (including Fishing Season Closed card), although 7 rounds (6 Event cards before the Fishing Season Closed card) also works for an engaged class.\nFor the gameplay there is no specific playthrough video, as the gamethrough is the same as normal Big Fish game, except for the setup of the Event cards (don’t reveal the setup of Event cards to the students!).\nWhen playing the game, in each round students can take their turn all at once (which is faster) or in a consecutive order (which could be more interactive).\nPlay the game twice, if time permits, to allow students to test different adaptation strategies.

    "text": "Extension to Years 11–12\nThis design can be extended for Years 11 and 12. For example in Year 11 Biology Unit 1, students are expected to investigate ecosystems as dynamic systems (biotic + abiotic factors) and use science inquiry skills: posing questions, designing an investigation, analysing data, evaluating limitations, and communicating evidence-based conclusions. Instead of framing the lesson as playing a game, frame it around the concept of using the game as a model to improve understanding. The Big Fish activity becomes the model system they run repeatedly under different conditions (treatments), then analyse like an experiment. The assessment can then be more focused around the evaluation of options and why they chose that specific action to create and event around.\nTo simulate replications\nInstead of one play per group, each group plays at least 3 games for each setup (treatment), or the class divides treatments and pools the data.\nTo simulate treatments\nYear 11 students will create, evaluate and compare multiple approaches to helping increase the resilience of local marine ecosystems. These may include combinations such as marine protected areas and seaweed planting, or single solutions such as the installation of a shellfish reef."

Join IMAS Professor Gretta Pecl as she explains what climate change is doing to our oceans right now. A sharp, classroom friendly explanation of species range shifts, ecosystem knock-on effects, and what it means for people who rely on the sea (3 mins).\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 2: effective marine protected areas\nMeet the ocean’s “no-take zones”: highly protected marine reserves where marine life can recover, breed, and thrive. This cartoon by Pew Foundation explains why marine reserves are one of the strongest tools we’ve got for ocean health and the need to push to protect ~30% of the ocean (2 mins).\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 3: seagrass restoration\nThis video to introduces habitat restoration through a real Australian case study: South Australia’s largest seagrass restoration trial rebuilding meadows off the Adelaide coast. This video by the Department of Environment and Water (SA) will facilitate discussion on why seagrass matters and how to measure success over time (1.5 mins)\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 4: ocean acidification explainer 1\nCO₂ doesn’t just warm the planet, it also changes ocean chemistry, making seawater more acidic and harder for shelled animals to build and keep their shells. This short Pew Foundation video explains how carbon dioxide emissions lead to acidification, and why it matters for food webs, fisheries, and reef health (2 mins)\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 5: ocean acidification explainer 2\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency video explaining how ocean acidification works and why it is important (5 mins)\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 6: illegal fishing\nIllegal fishing isn’t “a few rule breakers” it’s organised, high-profit theft that strips oceans of fish and cheats coastal communities. This Pew Foundation cartoon explains what illegal fishing looks like, why it’s so hard to police at sea, and the ripple effects on food security and marine ecosystems (2 mins)\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 7: ecosystem based fisheries management\nFisheries management needs to change from the question “How many fish can we catch?” to “How do we keep the whole system healthy enough to keep producing fish?” This Pew Foundation cartoon shows why managing habitat, bycatch, predators, prey, and food-web links together is the key to sustainable fisheries long-term (2 mins).\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 8: algal blooms\nSouth Australia’s algal bloom isn’t just about bad looking water it’s a real-time crisis affecting marine life and the people who depend on the coast. This Behind the News video unpacks what fuels a bloom, what it does to ecosystems, and why these events are becoming a big challenge (4 mins)\n\n\n\nOpen on YouTube"
