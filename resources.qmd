## Training resources

[***Machine learning based image collection, annotation and classification***](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/Course-MLforImageProcessing/)

In this online course you will learn about:

1.  concepts of data science, machine learning (ML), computer vision, deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2.  how to pre-process and pre-annotate images to accelerate your ML projects
3.  how to apply data augmentation techniques
4.  how to build an image classification model with your own or example data

The course uses freely available libraries and computing resources on Google Colaboratory
