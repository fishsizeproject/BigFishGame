Big Fish can be used as a hands-on way to explore marine ecosystems, science and geography, sustainability, human–nature interactions and even arts or writing.

There are plenty of options to use the game in the lessons, and our experience shows that engaging with the real physical game makes the class experience more interactive and fun. The game is suitable for ages 12+ and we mostly recommend it for years 9-12. The Big Fish team is always happy to hear from teachers and keen to bring ocean wonders and big fish stories to the class. Please reach out if you would like to use the game in the class, need additional resources or would like to suggest **your own ways** of how the game could be used in teaching.

- A multi-lesson unit to explore multiple concepts

### Practical tips

- **Class size:** works best for 5 to 20 students
- **Time required:** 30 minutes to two hours
- **Materials needed:** several game decks (contact us for a teacher pack) and printouts provided here
- **Assessments:** the game lends itself to creative and engaging assessments, like designing new cards or management options, creating presentations or diving deeper into marine science.

## Testimonials

*"Our marine biology students found the Big Fish game and its associated activities to be both engaging and highly educational. The beautiful artwork, featuring local Tasmanian fishes, immediately captured their attention and proved to be far more effective than a traditional fish ID book. The game provided a welcome respite from more formal study, while still aligning perfectly with the curriculum. The scenarios presented on the event cards were particularly valuable, serving as fantastic conversation starters and a natural way to launch into deeper learning. Once the students became confident with the rules, the game transformed into an eye-opening experience. They quickly grasped the ecological importance of big fish within marine ecosystems, and the gameplay reinforced this concept in a way that was both memorable and enjoyable. Overall, the Big Fish game proved to be an excellent teaching tool that blended fun, art, and science seamlessly – truly STEAM"*  
— Jan Seiler, science teacher from Hobart College
