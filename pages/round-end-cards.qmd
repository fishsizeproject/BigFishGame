## El Niño begins {#sec-el-nino-begins}

When an El Niño is present on the south east coast of Australia more heatwaves, strong swells and storms affect the ocean. Increases in sea surface temperature can also occur. This can mean smaller individuals of a species are less likely to be able to survive these events. Species such as [Abalone](fish-cards.qmd#sec-abalone) have also been observed as having decreased reproductive ability as heatwaves and severe weather cause physiological stress. There is also evidence that fish move away from certain coastal areas, meaning fishing ability is potentially changed in El Niño years.

## Fisheries research occurs {#sec-fisheries-research}

Fisheries have collapsed in the past, and species have been overcaught to the verge of extinction. This can come as a surprise – there may still be fish being caught, and the fish may appear to be plentiful. In reality we are just getting better at catching them, or the remaining population can reach a critical point beyond which recovery is challenging without intervention. For instance, if most of the breeding population has been fished and the remaining population is being fished too fast, then the individuals left don’t have a chance to reproduce. 

This is more likely with fish that mature at an old age, such as orange roughy that need to survive 27-32 years before they can reproduce. In the 1980s and 1990s orange roughy were being harvested by fisheries so fast that the fishery collapsed (it was no longer economically viable to harvest these fish as too few were being caught each trip). Without baseline information on how a population is structured in terms of age, size and genetics, we are unable to determine how the population is responding to harvesting by people. With this information however, managers can intervene to save a species and ensure sustainable harvesting into the future.

## Localised species extinction {#sec-localised-species-extinction}

Biodiversity loss (a decline in the number of species present in an ecosystem) is known to cause the ocean ecosystem to weaken in its ability to adapt and withstand changes. These changes include events such as marine heatwaves, climate change and weather patterns. An ecosystem with lower biodiversity is much more likely to suffer severe negative effects than a more biodiverse and resilient ocean ecosystem.

### How to play

When this card is drawn at the end of a round, the subsequent round will have no face-up cards present. This means that all cards that refer to face-up cards will no longer be able to be used during the round where this card is active.

## Ocean acidification {#sec-ocean-acidification}

If any [abalone](fish-cards.qmd#sec-abalone), [lobster](fish-cards.qmd#sec-southern-rock-lobster), or [crab](fish-cards.qmd#sec-red-rock-crab) cards are present in a player’s fishing spot they must discard them.

### How to play

Increasing atmospheric carbon increases the amount of carbon which dissolves into the ocean at the surface, resulting in a change in the ocean’s pH. Between 1950 and 2020 the average pH of the ocean shifted from 8.15 to 8.0, meaning it has become more acidic. In more acidic waters, it becomes increasingly difficult for animals to grow their shells and carbonate skeletons.

## Plankton swarm occurs {#sec-plankton-swarm}

Both phytoplankton (tiny plants) and the zooplankton (tiny animals) that feed on them are key steps in the food chain of many fish, shellfish, and other marine animals. Like plants, phytoplankton (which are usually microalgae) use sunlight to power chemical reactions that enable them to utilise resources in their environment and grow. This tiny little packages of nutrients are then predated upon by slightly larger (but still small) animals called zooplankton, and eventually fish. 

The availability of key resources in the environment, mainly nutrients such as iron, is what limits  phytoplankton growth. When sudden inputs of these nutrients become available, often the phytoplankton have everything else they need to survive and flourish - sometimes to the extent that phytoplankton blooms cause problems for humans (such as red tides).

## Fisheries impose upper size limit {#sec-upper-size-limit}

Large, old fish often produce disproportionately large numbers of offspring compared to fish of smaller sizes. Larger fish therefore contribute more to the next generation of fish which can be harvested. Protecting large ‘mega-spawners’ results in a greater yield of future fish. A 80 cm snapper produces ~24 times the offspring of a 40 cm snapper (but they both taste just as good!) and releasing the larger fish means more fish next year. In addition to producing disproportionately more young, large fish also connect different populations of fish – ensuring a rich and diverse gene-pool for tackling disease outbreaks and adapting to new conditions. Not all fish are made equal – big fish are more important to fish conservation into the future.
