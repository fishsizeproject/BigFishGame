## Blue Groper {#sec-blue-groper}

Blue Gropers can be an ecologically important species that help prevent the creation of urchin barrens that occur due to the presence of the Long-spine sea urchin. Whilst they may do little to reverse barren areas their presence as a predator of grazing urchins helps prevent the creation of barrens. They have also been shown to keep marine habitats balanced through predation of other marine invertebrates.

## Catch or release {#sec-catch-or-release}

Releasing caught fish, either because they are unwanted or for ocean health (i.e. releasing large breeding females) can reduce the impact of recreational fishing on fish stocks, thus leaving more fish for the future in a healthy ocean. Survival rates of fish featured in the game (such as [Yellowtail Kingfish](fish-cards.qmd#sec-yellowtail-kingfish)) can be above 85% when released correctly, while flathead survival rates can be about 95%. 

Releasing caught fish can greatly help fish populations. If minimum or maximum size limits are in place, fish too small or too large must be safely released. Anglers also often chose to release unwanted fish or fish that are especially valuable for the ocean and fish populations, such as predatory or large fish. In fact, all fish are valuable in the sea! All fish that will not be consumed should be released back into the ocean safely. When released correctly, survival rates are very high - often over 90%.

### How to play

Choose a fish from the available face-up cards in the centre area of the game and either place it in your esky or release it into your fishing spot. The size of the fish will be mentioned on the card, and different cards will have different sizes of fish to be released or caught. 
Remember this card is discarded after use.

## Citizen science {#sec-citizen-science}

The collection of data is key to many animal and marine life studies. Conducting large analyses is important to get more accurate information and knowledge, but collecting large amounts of data can be difficult, time consuming and expensive. In the last decade, science and data collection have undergone a true revolution through citizen science. By creating ways for everyone to get involved and have input into a science project, the knowledge gained and the positive outcomes from research can be greatly amplified and shared with the wider community. 

The citizen science project [Redmap](https://www.redmap.org.au/) featured on the card stands for Range Extending Database. The research from Redmap involves the collection of marine animal observations from all over Australia and examines how animals are extending their ranges due to warming oceans and changing climates.

## Centre for Marine Socioecology (CMS) {#sec-cms}

The [Centre for Marine Socioecology (CMS)](https://marinesocioecology.org/) provides, develops and integrates multidisciplinary research to better understand and manage Australia’s oceans. They do this by connecting, cooperating and collaborating across multiple organisations and different research disciplines. Their members range from marine scientists to philosophers, artists, economists and more.

Collaboration across multiple fields is an extremely important aspect of research but is often difficult to achieve. The CMS card in Big Fish aims to highlight how working together in areas such as research produces many wide-reaching benefits.

## Delicious bait {#sec-delicious-bait}

It’s important when collecting bait for recreational fishing activities to think about the potential impact bait collection has. Some bait collection activities that occur in excess can lead to a decline in bait presence as well as negatively impacting shore bird species. Often the collection process can be the primary cause of population declines. Examples include removing boulders or rocks in search of bait crabs.

Many baits can be collected sustainably especially if care is taken to prevent damage to the habitat the bait is collected from. Often there will be local rules and limits of bait collection just like recreational fishing bag limits. It is important that local rules are obeyed and consulted to ensure sustainable bait and thus a healthy and productive marine ecosystem. 

- [This page](http://ukmpa.marinebiodiversity.org/uk_sacs/activities/bait-collection/bc15.htm) has a lot of useful information on bag limits, researve, protected areas, and other measures in place to protect fish stocks.

## Giant kelp {#sec-giant-kelp}

Giant Kelp provides a huge, complex, and food-filled habitat which is essential for healthy oceans and healthy fish populations. Giant kelp forests produce much greater amounts of food for particularly important species of fish and invertebrate than other types of kelp forest, and those species feed back into the larger marine ecosystem. 

However, giant kelp forests around Australia have been declining drastically for decades, mostly due to climate change. This is a huge loss of natural underwater “forests” that remains unknown by the general public. Many scientists and organisations are working to restore these kelp forests.

## Humpback whale {#sec-humpback-whale}

Great whales such as the humpback whale and blue whale are key species in helping to cycle nutrients throughout the ocean. Known as whale pumps, these animals help by pooping out large quantities of nutrients that are essential for smaller species such as phytoplankton to grow. For example, whales feed in deep waters but breathe at the surface, so they bring the nutrients to the surface when they poop.

This card is designed to showcase how a visiting large predator like a whale can provide positive impacts on a local environment. Whilst they may consume fish for food, they also supply vital nutrients that are required for a healthy marine habitat and fishing spot. This is why the card is discarded and why a smaller fish must be discarded to help a larger fish - while you may lose fish to whale feeding, you ultimately end up with more fish in the long run when whales are abundant in the ocean.

## Illegal fishing {#sec-illegal-fishing}

Illegal fishing means fishing that does not follow existing regulations, be they minimum or maximum size limits, bag limits, marine protected areas or other rules. Fishing regulations are essential for sustainable fishing, but in various countries up to 20% of anglers may not obey these rules. This card shows catching fish below or above the determined size limit hurts the population and the fishing, although the damage will naturally depend on how large the overall population is in the fishing spot. 

Through discarding a card, players can start to understand the overall negative effects of illegal fishing. Fishing rules and regulations are there to protect fish stocks and prevent depletion and over fishing. Not obeying these limits means a less productive and functional marine ecosystem.

## Large shark {#sec-large-shark}

The large shark card is present in BigFish to help show the value of apex predators in an ecosystem. Often, large predators are demonised by recreational fishers who mistakenly believe that they are actively predating on fish that could otherwise be caught. In fact, many sharks are primarily scavengers which feed upon sick and old fish, not those usually targeted during recreational fishing. Without large sharks, other food chains will be affected and the ocean can become out of balance. 

Sharks also keep species that predate on other important pieces of an ocean ecosystem in check. For example, many of a shark’s prey species eat [seaweed](#sec-seaweed), and without sharks to keep the fish population in check seaweed can become scarce. Seaweed is incredibly important in providing some species of juvenile fish with places to hide and live while in a small and vulnerable stage of life.

## Marine protected area {#sec-marine-protected-area}

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important tool for habitat and species conservation. While they are not a standalone solution, they can be used to ensure species and ecosystems survive into the future. 

One way marine protected areas benefit recreational fishers is that fish from the protected area can “spill over” into neighbouring areas. This works because the breeding stock of large individuals in the marine protected area are safe from fishing and will produce offspring to repopulate fishing spots. Without these protected areas, the big fish will lose protection and have the potential to be caught, so they won’t produce as many offspring for the future. 

There are many other benefits to marine protected areas and while they need to be used in conjunction with planning and research they are still an important asset to recreational fishers.

### How to play

This card is used during the draw phase of your turn. Before drawing any cards have a look to see if any fish present in the face-up area match those present in an opponent’s fishing spot. If there are any matches then you may take that fish card into your hand in addition to any other cards drawn during the draw step.

## Poor water quality {#sec-poor-water-quality}

Poor water quality affects many parts of a marine ecosystem in many different ways. This card aims to show a more general effect, and not highlight a single source of poor water quality. Examples of the sources of poor water quality include excessive runoff from farming and stormwater which may contain excessive sediments or nutrients. Both of these contaminants can prevent photosynthesis both directly and indirectly, and so can damage seaweed reefs and seagrass beds.

## SCUBA equipment {#sec-scuba-equipment}

SCUBA diving collection can be a great way to selectively target certain fishable species. This often results in less bycatch and habitat destruction. However, some species are very easily collected and SCUBA diving whilst fishing can result in severe stock damage. It is therefore important to use SCUBA gear responsibly and obey the rules of which species can and cannot be caught on SCUBA.

## Seaweed {#sec-seaweed}

Seaweeds create important habitats for many fish species. Inside seaweed reefs fish forage for food and seek refuge from predators. Without these reefs many small and juvenile fish will not survive. A lack of seaweed also alters the balance between herbivorous and carnivorous fish that can further degrade a marine ecosystem.

## Severe weather {#sec-severe-weather}

Big fish can survive extreme weather events better than smaller fish of the same species. Therefore, the science shows that a population of fish is more at risk of decline and slower population recovery when larger individuals of that species are not present. This card highlights how a changing climate and more extreme weather events mean that fishing spots with larger fish of a species present are in a much better position to recover to prevent health levels than those lacking larger fish.

## Shellfish reef {#sec-shellfish-reef}

Shellfish reefs provide many important ecosystem services and improve the general health of marine environments. They are particularly good at providing the complex habitat that is important to the development of larval and juvenile fish. By providing places for the fish to hide and feed, they help increase the recruitment and survival of many fish species. They also benefit the ecosystem through processes like water filtering, overall increasing ecosystem health and thus fish stock levels.
