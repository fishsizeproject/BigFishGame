## The first big event

The Festival of Bright Ideas held down at Princes Pier in Hobart was the Big Fish Card Game's first big event. The team from the Fish Size Project that developed Big Fish were all on station to show the game off to hundreds of school students and a host of families over the 2 day event. The game was played so many times the crew lost count.

With only a few weeks till launch FOBI was a great test of how engaging, educational and fun the game can be. The feedback from the students and families was overwhelmingly positive with many excited to get their hand on the game and support the project.
